    <p> Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil<br>
      game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing<br>
      three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming<br> 
      best play from both players. </p>
  </div>

  <section>
    <p> Player 1 and player 2 take turns clicking on the 9 boxes of tic tac toe. Note that right after the button has been clicked by a<br>
      player, it will be disabled which means that it cannot be clicked again by either of the players. The symbol will automatically<br>
      switch between O and X after every click.
    </p>
    <p>When the same symbol (either O or X) connects in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, that user wins. The game is over and<br>
      the results are displayed.
